Decided to follow this blog and make a new repo for argocd to be installed with helm

blog for setup: https://www.arthurkoziel.com/setting-up-argocd-with-helm/

blog for creating local users: https://faun.pub/create-argo-cd-local-users-9e830db3763f

idk if I'll keep the one repo like the blog shows or not - I think I'll end up seperating things out into terraform stuff but idk.

So see my argocd-helm repo for this
