# Archivebox

I added a telegram bot for this that deploys in its own container but there's a caveat about some cookies that it would need.

Instructions for getting the cookies are in the [source repo](https://github.com/pypeaday/ArchiveboxTelegramBot?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use) but to use my role just place the cookies.txt into `./roles/archivebox/templates/cookies.txt`
